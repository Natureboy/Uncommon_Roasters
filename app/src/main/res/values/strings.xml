    <string name="about_us_1">\nUncommon Coffee Roasters opened in the spring of 1994 with a goal of providing the best fresh
        roasted specialty coffee to our customers. We take pride in our product and expect all of our employees to do so as well.
        We stress education, consistency, and customer service as the three areas of focus for our baristas.\n</string>

    <string name="about_us_2"> There is something to be said about small. After all,
        the best things come in small packages. At Uncommon Coffee Roasters we believe in small.
        We purchase our coffees from small growers in small farms or cooperatives. When possible,
        we travel to these farms to personally meet the farmers, ensure they are paid fairly and to guarantee
        the quality our customers would expect. Our coffee is always roasted in small batches to guarantee optimal
        quality every time we roast. \n</string>

    <string name="about_us_3"> We source our green coffee globally, traveling to the origin whenever possible.
        Once our beans arrive to us, we store them in ideal conditions to guarantee the freshest coffee possible.
        When it comes to roasting we are proud to say that we only roast in small batches. Roasting in small batches
        allows us to ensure that we roast each and every batch to perfection every time we roast.\n</string>

    <string name="about_us_4"> We proudly provide coffee to small cafes and to large corporations.
        We consider our wholesale customers our partners. We assist our customers in growing their coffee sales.
        We can provide equipment, training and consultation. Our goal is to insure that our wholesale customers provide
        the best product possible and the quality that they could only expect from Uncommon Coffee Roasters.\n</string>

    <string name="fh_pour">Pouring Water</string>
    <string name="ft_pour_top">For the recipes in the Coffee Wizard to be applicable, the user must pour the water
        as restricted and slowly as possible without letting the water stream drip. This will maximize consistency
        and let the grind size and coffee density determine our overall brew time. Start by pouring the water from
        the center out to the edge of the brewer in quick circles as to saturate all grounds evenly.
        Remember, we want a restricted flow, but quick circles.</string>

    <string name="fh_grind_q">Grind Quality</string>
    <string name="ft_grind">Most of the brew recipes and brewers will use a similar grind
        size. Start by matching the grind size to the picture provided. If your coffee tastes
        sour or brews too quickly, adjust the grind FINER. If the the coffee tastes bitter or
        brews too slowly, grind the coffee COARSER. The grind size for the V60 and Press pot
        will be very similar for our recipes, but the chemex will use a slightly coarser grind.
        The grounds should feel like a medium fine table salt if run between your fingers. \n
    </string>
    <string name="fsh_grinders">Grinders </string>
    <string name="ft_grinders">All grinders will perform differently, even the same models
        will vary slightly. Successful coffee brewing comes from maximizing the uniformity
        (evenness) of ground coffee particles because the particle size determines how quickly
        the coffee will be extracted.\n</string>
    <string name="ft_grind_burr">Burr Grinders - Burr grinders supply the best grind uniformity,
        however, flat burrs tend to do a better job than conical burrs. In addition to the burrs’
        teeth shape, the size of the burrs matter too. We tend to favor larger burrs because they
        chop the coffee a greater number of times before the grounds exit the grinder. This means
        that it is more likely that the grounds will end up being the correct size.\n</string>
    <string name="ft_grind_blade">Blade Grinders - Blade grinders work, but they aren’t
        ideal as you can’t control the particle size. Try experimenting with pulsing and
        shaking the grinder so that all parts of the beans are chopped. \n</string>
